# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Repository

This repository contains comprehensive explanations and practical examples of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. It is designed to help learners understand the fundamental and advanced aspects of OOP through structured examples and use cases.

## Topics Covered

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** - Introduction to the four pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction, with real-world examples.
2. **OOPs - Constructors** - Detailed insights into constructors, types of constructors (default, parameterized, copy), constructor overloading, and their role in object initialization.
3. **OOPs - Part 2** - Advanced OOP concepts, including method overloading, method overriding, and deep diving into class hierarchies.
4. **OOPs - Super & Abstraction** - Explanation of the `super` keyword for accessing parent class members and the concept of abstraction using abstract classes and interfaces.
5. **Static** - Understanding the `static` keyword, its use in static methods, variables, blocks, and class-level memory management.
6. **ENUM** - Exploring Java Enums, their benefits, and best practices for using them effectively in switch-case statements and data representation.
7. **Wrapper Class** - Explanation of wrapper classes, autoboxing, and unboxing, and their significance in Java collections and generics.
8. **Exceptions** - Comprehensive guide to exception handling, different types of exceptions (checked, unchecked), custom exceptions, try-catch-finally blocks, and the `throws` keyword.
9. **Generics** - Understanding generics in Java, their importance in type safety, and applications in collections and methods.
10. **Collection Framework** - Detailed explanation of the Java Collection Framework, including List, Set, Map, and their implementations like ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, and TreeMap.
